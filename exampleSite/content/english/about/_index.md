## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Sikhsaspace started shaping up when we began teaching students in 1990 for the sheer purpose of “education for everyone”. 

‘Sikshaspace’ is the SPACE in which we offer college and university students new ideas, perspectives, and novel ways of learning through formal and informal setups. We also make them aware of the career options and the avenues for higher studies available for their background and discipline. This helps them to focus on and prepare for the future and they can transition to work-life smoothly. For example, for students doing graduation in English Honours, we help them by offering both broader and deeper training in their subject and also prepare them for appropriate careers in fields like academics, civil services, journalism, and public relations. 

We aim to achieve this by consolidating the expertise of a range of highly creative and capable academics and other professionals from different fields, who will share their knowledge and expertise with students enrolled with us. Besides, we equip our students with skills that make them job-ready. In the process, we also aim to mitigate the unequal access to educational resources due to a variety of socio-economic reasons.
