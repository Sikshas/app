    Sikhsaspace started shaping up when we began teaching students in 1990 for the sheer purpose of “education for everyone”. ‘Sikshaspace’ is the SPACE in which we offer college and university students new ideas, perspectives, and novel ways of learning through formal and informal setups. We also make them aware of the career options and the avenues for higher studies available for
    their background and discipline. This helps them to focus on and prepare for the future and they can transition to work-life smoothly.

    to focus on and prepare for the future and they can transition to work-life smoothly.\n\nFor
    example, for students doing graduation in English Honours, we help them by offering
    both broader and deeper training in their subject and also prepare them for appropriate
    careers in fields like academics (higher studies in India & Abroad), civil services,
    journalism, and public relations.\n\nOur success stories include \nK. K. Das College,
